# Porject Descripotion

WaterFill, is a simple simulation of a glass being filled with water. The user can press the "+" button to add water to an empty glass, and continue to press it to fill the glass up to a maximum level. Conversely, the user can press the "-" button to remove water from the glass, with each press lowering the water level until the glass is empty. This project is intended as a fun and interactive way to demonstrate the principles of fluid dynamics and provide a user-friendly interface for users to play around with.
